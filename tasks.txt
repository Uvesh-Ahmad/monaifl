We had a quick session to discuss the requirements we would need to include in the FL 
code you are writing before we could get it into FLIP, here's a quick breakdown:

 - modify the 'compute plan' functionality to include test (at the client) 
   and aggregation (at the server) steps after the current train (client) 
   and aggregate (server) steps
 - include the results from these 'test' and 'aggregation' steps in the output file
 - log the start and finish of each step at the client and server, along with any errors
 - implement a callback once the full 'compute plan' has finished, so we can advise out
   to researchers
 - containerise the code for deployment in Kubernetes
 - ensure all metrics from client and server steps are included in output file

Jim / me are hoping to get this into a nice diagram with further details so we can define
testing steps but for now, can you say if you would be able to implement the above 
requirements? and if so, a rough estimate of how long it might take? our deadline 
for code complete on FLIP is end of October, is this realistic?

We'll work on getting more detail around the requirements and drawing some useful diagrams.

Any questions, please ask!
